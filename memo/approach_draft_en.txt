# Instrument Approach


The fun of flying an airplane is of course flying freely like a bird, watching scenery 
that you can never see from the ground.  In addition to that, landings are also a fun 
thing to do.  I never get boredf of landing practice in Cessna 172.

In addition to that, instrument approaches is also a huge fun.  In a bad weather, flying 
an airplane according to the guidance from air traffic controllers may sound totally 
opposite from flying freely like a bird over a magnificent view.  But, it's fun!  Really. 
When you make a beautiful ILS approach, the satisfaction you get is something you can 
never experience anywhere else.

So, I wanted to add that aspect of fun in YSFLIGHT, and added a virtual air traffic controller
sinde Spring 2012 version.  Although the implementation is primitive, the air traffic 
controller will guide you through the bad weather to your destination.

In the rest of the document, I assume you are able to fly in a bad weather.  You are 
supposed to be able to maintain your heading, altitude, and air speed.  I may eventually 
write how you can practice what's called attitude instrument flying, but you can also 
find a lot of literature on the Internet.  Maybe you want to search for "attitude instrument
flying".

Also, I assume the default key binding.  If you customized the binding, please interpret 
accordingly.

Now, let's take off Misawa air base and shoot an ILS approach to Hachinohe air base!





# Setting up the simulation
Let's start YSFLIGHT and create a new flight.  Follow the instructions below.
(1) Select [Simulation]->[Create New Flight] menu.
(2) In [General] tab, select [AOMORI], and in [Starting Position] select [MISAWA_RW10].
(3) You can pick whatever airplane you are comfortable with.  But, jet fighters may be
    too fast for you until you are used to IFR flying.  Maybe a trainer airplane or a
    propeller airplane is easier.  How about [T-4_BLUE_IMPULSE] or [HAWK_REDARROWS]?
    These are nice trainers.
(4) In [Environment] tab, create a bad weather.  Select 1 mile visibility, and turn on
    the check box beside the cloud layer ceiling 800ft, 300ft thick.
(5) Click on [Fly Now!] button.





#Let's fly!

In IFR flying, you are supposed to fly ahead of the airplane, means that you need to 
configure radio frequencies, navigation equipments, etc., adequately before you need 
to do.  So, let's set up ILS 07 approach in NAV 1.  Follow the instruction below.

(1) Press L key to open NAV 1 sub menu.
(2) Select ILS [07-HACHINOHE]

Then, request approach to the air traffic controller.  In the real-world flying, you 
need to file an IFR flight plan, getting a clearance frou clearance delivery or ground 
controller, then get taxi clearance ...., but YSFLIGHT's air traffic control system is 
not that sophisticated yet.  (Well, in the real world, you never start from the end 
of the runway.)  Follow the instruction below.

(1) Press Entery key to Radio-Communication menu.
(2) Select [Air Traffic Controller]
(3) Select [Request Approach]
(4) Select [ILS 07-HACHINOHE]

Then, you will see an instruction from the ATC.

"Runway Heading, Climb maintain 1500, Cleared for Take Off."

So, you are cleared for take off!  After take off, keep the same heading, and go up to
1500ft.  At 800ft, you will go into the cloud.  And, when you reach 1500ft, you will get
a new instruction like:

"Turn right heading 195, Climb maintain 2000."

Then turn right to heading 195, and you need to climb up to 2000ft.  In IFR condition,
basically you may want to keep bank angle no greater than 20 degree.  In a real airplane,
you are supposed to look at the turn coordinator and make a standard-rate turn (360 degrees 
in 2 minutes), but in YSFLIGHT, some airplanes are not equipped with the turn coordinator.
So, let's keep it a 20 degree bank turn.

Eventually, you will see:

"Reduce speed XXXkt"

Then, deccelerate to the given speed and maintain it.  When you think you messed up,
you can request to the ATC "Request New Vector" by pressing Enter key and select it 
from the sub-menu.

If you are able to follow the instruction well, you will hear:

"Turn left (right) heading XXX, maintain YYYY, Intercept Localizer"
"Cleared for ILS-07 HACHINOHE"

Now, you are cleared for ILS approach.  Some moment after turning to the given heading,
you will see the localizer needle (vertical needle) moving toward the center.  As soon 
as you see the needle moving, start turn to the runway heading.  In this case, heading 
070 because you are shooting an approach to runway 07.  At this time, reduce speed to 
the final-approach speed, lower landing gear, lower flaps as needed.

In the real-world flying, the ATC will tell you to contact tower around this time, but 
again, YSFLIGHT's air-traffic controlling system is not that sophisticated yet.  From 
this point, you are on your own.  Follow the ILS, and bring your airplane down to the
runway in one piece.

But, if you really messed up, you can "Declare Missed Approach" to the ATC by pressing 
Enter key and select it from the sub-menu.  If you do so, the ATC will give you new 
vector and guide you through the approach again.

Good luck!
