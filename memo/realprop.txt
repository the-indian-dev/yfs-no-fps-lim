For fixed-pitch propeller

MIN and MAX pitch must be set equal.  Pitch is the propeller average AOA at zero speed.

Propeller AOA, is the function of RPM and airspeed.  If the center of force is Rm away from the axis, 

  Velocity of the propeller is R*w.  
  T rpm-> T/60 rotation per second
  w=2*PI*T/60
  Vprop=2*PI*T*R/60

  K kt-> Vair=0.51*Km/s

Angle at which the blade slice through the air will be:

  Pangle=atan(Vair/Vprop)


1300RPM, 100kt, R=0.6m, MAX pitc=20deg
    -> Vprop=81m/s, Vair=51m/s, Pangle=32.1deg, AOA=-12
2000RPM, 110kt, R=0.6m, MAX pitc=20deg
    -> Vprop=125m/s, Vair=56m/s, Pangle=24.1deg, AOA=-4
2400RPM, 110kt, R=0.6m, MAX pitch=20deg
    -> Vprop=150m/s, Vair=56m/s, Pangle=20.4deg, AOA=-0.4



.... Engine brake!  It must be.  If, RPM is too high for the throttle setting, the engine must be producing the dumping force.

Cessna 172: Engine Brake is equilibrium at (Guess) 30% power, 110kt -> 1500RPM
